Jaimin
Assistant Professor
S&E - Math/Statistics Sciences

Welcome to my homepage. I am a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at UConn. Prior to this, I was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Maine. I completed my Ph.D in Mathematics under the supervision of Prof. Qingkai Kong from Northern Illinois University in 2017.

This year I am in the job market. I am looking for a tenure-track position in mathematical sciences. I am planning to consolidate all relevant information available via this website.

My research interests are in mainly in differential equations, primarily in boundary value problems and eigenvalue problems. I enjoy having conversations about mathematical and functional inequalities and their applications to differential equations. Lately, I started to explore some areas of mathematical physics and inverse problems. I am always happy to chat about my work and interested to know about my peers work. If you are interested, please feel free to to contact me. If you are a student and interested to work with me, please send me an email with your interest and background and we can have a conversation about that.

Beside mathematics, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and traveling. I have traveled to 35 states within the USA and I envision being a member of the 50 state club someday. I am a gastronomer and enjoy seafood the most (living in New England helps!). Italian and Japanese are two of my favorite cuisines- for me, distance is a mere number for fine cheese and delectable sushi! Other than the food, I am passionate about coffee, perfume, and single malt scotch. Cheers to that!

**I'll be on the job market starting in Fall 2021.** Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit for your academic department or industry research group.
