abstract = {Implicit constitutive relations afford a logically consistent framework for formulating strain-limiting, nonlinear elastic constitutive models utilizing the classical linearized strain tensor. This is in marked contrast to traditional Cauchy or Green elastic formulations which give rise to customary linear elasticity in the infinitesimal strain limit. Within this strain-limiting elastic constitutive setting, the present paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of the stress field at the tip of a straight plane-strain fracture. It is shown that within the general class of crack-tip asymptotic expansions considered, the only cases satisfying the required boundary conditions correspond to bounded stresses. This is in agreement with previous results for the corresponding anti-plane shear fracture problem.}
